# AI-CONTEXT.md

This is the first continuity file every AI session must read.

## Project Identity

- Project: XF Internal Linker V2
- Goal: local-first internal-link suggestion system for XenForo and WordPress content with manual review before any link is applied
- Previous version: `../xf-internal-linker/` (Flask + SQLite, feature-complete, 485+ tests)

## Canonical Documents

Execution order and FR IDs are decoupled.

1. `docs/v2-master-plan.md` - architecture and product specification
2. `AI-CONTEXT.md` - current repo state, phase ledger, next target
3. `FEATURE-REQUESTS.md` - backlog source of truth, request dates, request status, target/completed phases
4. `PROMPTS.md` - workflow guidance only

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.12 target runtime
- Django 5.2 LTS + DRF
- PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector
- Redis 7.4
- Celery 5.4 + Celery Beat
- Django Channels 4.2 + Daphne
- Embedding fallback/default code target: `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` with 768 dimensions
- Existing `ML_PERFORMANCE_MODE` behavior still supports CPU-safe and GPU-capable execution

### Frontend
- Node.js 22 LTS target runtime
- Angular 20 + Angular Material 20
- TypeScript 5.8
- SCSS with theme tokens in `frontend/src/styles/gsc-theme.scss`

## Current Phase

- Active target for the next session: Phase 15
- FR cross-reference: `FR-012 - Click-Distance Structural Prior`
- Status: Phase 14 / FR-011 is now implemented and verified for its approved scope; keep FR-012 separate from FR-011, FR-010, FR-009, and FR-008 evidence

## Current Session Note

- Session target: FR-011 implementation with sanity checks
- What changed:
  - implemented FR-011 from `docs/specs/fr011-field-aware-relevance-scoring.md`
  - added separate `Suggestion.score_field_aware_relevance` and `Suggestion.field_aware_diagnostics`
  - added separate field-aware settings API, pipeline snapshot wiring, algorithm version metadata, review exposure, and admin exposure
  - added separate backend scoring logic for title, body, scope labels, and learned-anchor vocabulary with bounded weighting
- What was intentionally not changed:
  - no FR-012 implementation
  - no replacement of FR-008 phrase scoring
  - no replacement of FR-009 learned-anchor corroboration
  - no replacement of FR-010 rare-term propagation
  - no business logic moved outside Django
- Continuity note:
  - FR-011 is now complete as a separate scoring layer
  - the HttpWorker helper addition from the prior session remains supporting infrastructure only and does not change the phase roadmap
  - the next code session should start Phase 15 / FR-012
- Verification completed:
  - direct Python 3.12 syntax check passed for the affected backend files
  - targeted Django tests passed with Docker-exposed Postgres and Redis overrides
  - migration drift check passed with `makemigrations --check --dry-run`
  - `git diff --check` passed
  - frontend unit tests could not be run in this session because Node/npm was not available on the host PATH

## User Communication Preference

- The user is not a developer and prefers plain-English, layman's-terms explanations by default.
- Default communication rule: AI should talk to the user in plain English and explain things like they are five.
- When explaining blockers, risks, test results, or architecture, lead with the simple version first.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon; if a technical term matters, define it briefly in the same reply.
- Keep answers practical and direct; do not assume deep framework or infrastructure knowledge.

Phase 8 shipped:
- read-only WordPress REST client for posts/pages with optional Application Password auth
- WordPress settings API and Angular settings UI for base URL, username, password, manual sync, and Celery Beat schedule
- WordPress `wp_post` and `wp_page` content typing plus `wp_posts` / `wp_pages` scopes
- cross-source existing-link graph refresh for `XF -> WP` and `WP -> XF`
- source-aware review/settings labeling so XenForo vs WordPress content is explicit
- local verification path repaired with Python 3.12 project environment, Django test settings, and Angular 20 build verified under Node.js 22
- frontend npm audit is clean after the Angular 20 toolchain uplift, and frontend `test:ci` now passes via a checked-in smoke test around the HTML-highlighting utility

Phase 9 shipped:
- ordered mixed-syntax internal-link extraction with persisted weighted-edge evidence on `ExistingLink`
- separate `march_2026_pagerank_score` authority computation path with source-row normalization, bounded weighting, and uniform-row fallback
- separate weighted-authority settings API, recalculation task, pipeline snapshotting, and minimal Angular settings controls
- review/admin/content diagnostics now use `march_2026_pagerank_score` as the authority score shown to users
- spec-derived backend tests and Angular review smoke coverage pass locally

Phase 10 shipped:
- separate `LinkFreshnessEdge` history rows keyed by `source -> destination`, with `first_seen_at`, `last_seen_at`, `last_disappeared_at`, and `is_active`
- safe sync behavior that updates history during body-parse paths, reactivates returning links, and does not mark disappearances on non-body paths
- separate `ContentItem.link_freshness_score` and `Suggestion.score_link_freshness` storage with neutral fallback at `0.5`
- separate Link Freshness settings API, recalculation task, bounded ranker hook, and review/admin/content diagnostics
- FR-007 verification passed for backend tests, migration drift, Angular `test:ci`, and Angular build

Phase 12 shipped:
- separate FR-009 learned-anchor vocabulary and corroboration service built only from inbound `ExistingLink.anchor_text`
- separate `Suggestion.score_learned_anchor_corroboration` and `Suggestion.learned_anchor_diagnostics` storage with neutral fallback at `0.5`
- separate Learned Anchor settings API, pipeline-run snapshot wiring, suggestion detail/admin diagnostics, and Angular review/settings exposure
- learned-anchor ranking impact is bounded, positive-only, and unchanged when `learned_anchor.ranking_weight = 0.0`
- FR-009 verification passed for the targeted Django test slice under SQLite test settings, Angular `test:ci`, Angular build, and migration drift check

## What Is Next

- Next exact target: Phase 15 / `FR-012 - Click-Distance Structural Prior`
- Phase 14 reference: `FR-011` shipped as a separate field-aware relevance layer and must stay separate from FR-008 phrase matching, FR-009 learned anchors, and FR-010 rare-term propagation
- Current continuity state: Phase 14 is complete for the approved FR-011 scope; the HttpWorker helper addition is separate supporting infrastructure only
- Next session type: dedicated FR-012 spec pass first, then implementation in a later session
- Scope reminder: do not hide FR-011 field evidence inside phrase/learned-anchor/rare-term logic while working on FR-012
- Required continuity rule: keep FR IDs and phase numbers explicitly cross-referenced; never infer ordering from the FR number

## Spec Standards for Patent-Derived Phases

Every phase that introduces new math or a patent-derived signal requires a dedicated spec pass before any implementation pass.

- Write the spec to `docs/specs/fr0XX-<slug>.md` before touching implementation code.
- The spec must include a source summary, a math-fidelity note, a full implementation spec, and a test plan. Use `docs/specs/fr006-weighted-link-graph.md` as the quality model.
- FR-007 (freshness): source the math from `US8407231B2`. Do not reuse freshness signals from FR-006's weighted edge features - the boundary is intentional.
- FR-008 (phrase matching): source the math from `US7536408B2`. Do not reuse phrase or surrounding-text signals from FR-006's edge features - the boundary is intentional.
- FR-016 to FR-020 also require a spec/design pass before implementation because they change telemetry schemas, attribution logic, alerting behavior, and model-promotion/runtime safety. Those phases must define neutral fallbacks, rollback paths, and regression gates before any code lands.
- All other patent-inspired phases follow the same two-pass pattern: spec first, implement second, each in its own session.
- FR-018 must also include adaptive-change alerts, immutable history/audit rows, exact timestamped "why weights changed" summaries, and a timeline view before implementation is considered complete.
- FR-019 owns generic operator alerts: model-download reminders, job-complete/failure notifications, bell sounds, desktop notifications, urgent trend warnings, and persisted error-linked alerts.
- FR-020 owns runtime model lifecycle: download, warmup, hot swap, drain, rollback, and zero-downtime model/backfill cutovers. Do not bury that work inside `FR-018`.
- Early user-requested spec drafts exist for:
  - `FR-016` at `docs/specs/fr016-ga4-suggestion-attribution-user-behavior-telemetry.md`
  - `FR-019` at `docs/specs/fr019-operator-alerts-notification-center.md`
- These do not change the active implementation target.

## Session Workflow

Every implementation session must:

1. Read `AI-CONTEXT.md` and `FEATURE-REQUESTS.md` before coding.
2. Inspect the repository and reconcile docs against actual code before trusting the docs.
3. Implement exactly one active phase unless the repo already proves that phase is complete before work starts.
4. Update `AI-CONTEXT.md` and `FEATURE-REQUESTS.md` at session end.
5. Update `PROMPTS.md` only when workflow guidance drifts from reality.
6. Stage only intended files; never stage `tmp/`, `backend/scripts/`, or unrelated changes.

## Pending Configuration

| Item | Why needed | State |
|---|---|---|
| XenForo base URL + API key | live XenForo sync and verification | Already wired; operator must supply real values in env/settings |
| WordPress base URL + optional username/app password | live WordPress sync; private content requires Application Password auth | UI/API shipped; operator must supply real values in env/settings |
| Local runtimes | build/test execution | Direct installed Python 3.12.10 and direct Node paths work for verification; the usual `py`/`python` launcher aliases and `.venv` launcher still need cleanup if a future session wants the shorter commands |

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails

### Product / Workflow
- GUI-first always
- Manual review remains in the loop
- Up to one best suggestion per destination per pipeline run
- Maximum 3 internal-link suggestions per host thread
- Only scan the first 600 words of host content for insertion
- Never write directly to XenForo or WordPress databases
- Read-only API access only

### Architecture
- Django + DRF backend, Angular frontend, full API separation
- PostgreSQL + pgvector for persistence
- Redis for cache, Celery broker, and channel layer
- Celery for background work; no inline heavy processing
- WebSockets for real-time updates; no HTTP polling
- Docker Compose for deployment

### ML / Ranking
- Destination = title + distilled body text
- Host = sentence-level body text within first 600 words
- Hybrid scoring = semantic + keyword + node affinity + quality + PageRank + velocity
- Embedding model fallback/default = `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` with 768 dimensions
- Existing mode-selection behavior still supports both CPU-safe and GPU-capable operation through `ML_PERFORMANCE_MODE`
- pgvector is the embeddings source of truth

### Git / Collaboration
- One narrow slice per AI session
- Commit/push only when verified as far as the environment allows
- Never force-push, rewrite history, or commit secrets
